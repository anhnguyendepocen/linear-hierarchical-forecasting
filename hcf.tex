Forecasting hierarchical or grouped time series includes two steps,
computing base forecasts and reconciling the forecasts. Base forecasts
can be computed by popular time series forecasting methods such as
Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA). The reconceliation step is a linear process that adjusts the
base forecasts. However using ETS or ARIMA for base forecasts can be
computatioanaly challenging due to the large number of series
forecastes. In this research we propose a set of linear models that
alternates this computational problem. Our method provides a single-step
reconceliation onapproach instead of the two-step approach. The proposed
method is also more flexible in incorporating external data handeling
missing values. We illustrate our approach using two real datasets, on
Australian domestic tourism and Wikipedia pageviews. We compare our
approach with reconceliation using ETS and ARIMA, and show that our
approach is much faster and at the same time competes well in terms of
forecasting accuracy.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{Hierarchical and grouped time
series}\label{hierarchical-and-grouped-time-series}

The increasing internet usage and digitization has dramatically is
increased the amount of collected time series data. For example, the
Internet of Things (IoT) produces huge amount of series in short period
of time. Forecasting large collections of time series is computationally
heavy and challenging. In some cases these time series can be structured
and disaggregated based on hierarchies or groups such as geographical
location and gender. An example of hierarchical time series is sales in
restaurant chains, which can be disaggregated into different branches
and then different foods or drinks. Figure \ref{fig:hierarchicalexample}
shows a schematic os such a hierarchical time series structure. In this
example the hierarchy includes three levels: Top level, level 0, is the
total series which is the aggregation of all the bottom level series. In
the middle level, level 1, series are aggregation of their own bottom
level series. For instance, series A is the aggregation of AA and AB.
Finally, the bottom level series, level 2, include the most
disaggregated series.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=280px,height=180px]{Paper-Figures/hierarchical_example} 

}

\caption{An example of a two level hierarchy structure}\label{fig:hierarchicalexample}
\end{figure}

Grouped time series are more complicated aggregation structures compared
with hierarchical time series. They can be defined as hierarchical time
series without unique hierarchy structure \autocite{hyndman2015hts}. A
schematic of a grouped time series structure is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:groupexample}. Series in this structure can be split first into
group A and B and then into C and D (left side) or first in C and D and
then in A and B (right side) \autocite{hyndman2016fast}. In the
following, we use the same notation for both hierarchy and grouped time
series.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=280px,height=180px]{hcf_files/figure-latex/groupexample-1} 

}

\caption{An example of two level grouped structure}\label{fig:groupexample}
\end{figure}

Using the notations in \textcite{hyndman2016fast}, we denote the total
series at time \(t\) by \(y_t\), and the series in node \(Z\) at time
\(t\) is denoted by \(y_{Z,t}\). For generating different levels of
series from the bottom level series, we use an \(n\times n_k\) matrix,
called the `summing matrix', denoted by \(S\), in which \(n\) is the
overall number of nodes and \(n_k\) is the number of bottom level nodes.
For example in Figure \ref{fig:hierarchicalexample}, \(n = 7\) and
\(n_k = 4\). This summing matrix can be partitioned based on different
levels of the hierarchy. Using the `summing matrix', generating a
hierarchy structure at time \(t\) is given by
\(\mathbf{y_t}=\mathbf{Sb_t}\), where \(\mathbf{y_t}\) is a vector of
all the level nodes at time \(t\) and \(\mathbf{b_t}\) is the vector of
all the bottom level nodes at time \(t\). For the example shown in
Figure \ref{fig:hierarchicalexample}, the hierarchy equation involving
the \(S_{7\times 4}\) matrix can be written as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Smatrixexample}
\left(\begin{array}{c} 
y_{t}\\y_{A,t}\\y_{B,t}\\y_{AA,t}\\y_{AB,t}\\y_{BA,t}\\y_{BB,t}\\
\end{array}\right)
=\left(\begin{array}{cccc} 
1&1&1&1\\1&1&0&0\\0&0&1&1\\1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\\
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c} 
y_{AA,t}\\y_{AB,t}\\y_{BA,t}\\y_{BB,t}\\
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{forecasting-hierarchical-time-series}{\subsection{Forecasting
hierarchical time series}\label{forecasting-hierarchical-time-series}}

In hierarchical time series, because the most disaggregated or bottom
level series are highly noisy their forecasting results are less
accurate. At the same time, the most aggregated (total) series is
smoother and less noisy and therefore forecasting it is easier
\autocite{fliedner2001hierarchical}. If we just forecast each series
individually, we are ignoring the hierarchy or grouping structure
\autocite{hyndman2016fast}. The result is that, summing forecast values
from lower levels does not necessarily coincide with the higher level
(more aggregated) forecasts. Also, forecasting the most disaggregated
level series and computing other level series by summing forecasts can
result in poor forecasts at higher levels.

In the literature there are several methods that consider the hierarchy
structure information in forecasting time series. These include the
top-down \autocite{gross1990disaggregation}, bottom-up
\autocite{kahn1998revisiting}, middle-out and optimal combination
\autocite{hyndman2011optimal} approaches. In the top-down approach, we
first forecast the total series and then disaggregate the forecast to
lower level series based on a set of historical and forecasted
proportions (for details see \textcite{athanasopoulos2009hierarchical}).
In the bottom-up approach, the forecasts in each level of the hierarchy
can be computed by aggregating the bottom level series forecasts. In the
middle-out approach, the process can be started from one of the middle
levels and other forecasts can be computed using aggregation for upper
levels and disaggregation for lower levels. Finally, optimal combination
uses all the \(n\) forecasts for all of the series in the entire
hierarchy structure, and then uses regression models to reconcile the
resulting forecasts. The advantage of the optimal combination method
compared with the other methods is that it considers the interactions
and correlation among the series in all the levels of hierarchy. This
method also provides forecast uncertainty and is flexible for ad hoc
adjustment.

In the optimal combination method, base forecasts can be computed using
the following linear model:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:baseforecasts}
   \mathbf{\hat{y}_h} = \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{\beta_h}+\epsilon_h
\end{equation}

where \(\mathbf{\hat{y}_h}\) represents a vector of \(h\)-step-ahead
base forecasts for all levels of the hierarchy, \(\boldsymbol{\beta_h}\)
is the unknown conditional mean of the bottom level series, and
\(\epsilon_h\) is the aggregation error which has mean equal to zero and
variance equal to \(\sum_h\) \autocite{hyndman2016fast}. Using Equation
\eqref{eq:baseforecasts} and estimating \(\boldsymbol{\beta_h}\),
forecasts in all levels of the hierarchy can be computed. Since
estimating \(\boldsymbol{\beta_h}\) using Generalized Least Squares
(GLS) requires knowledge of \(\sum_h\), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) can
be used and then a vector of reconciled forecast can be calculated using
Equation \eqref{eq:reconciledforecasts}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reconciledforecasts}
   \mathbf{\tilde{y}_{h}}=\mathbf{S(S'S)^{-1}S'}\mathbf{\hat{y}_h}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Challenges and motivation}\label{challenges-and-motivation}

\textcite{hyndman2015hts} implemented a package called \textbf{hts} in R
(R core \textcite{team2013r}) for forecasting hierarchical time series
including all the approaches mentioned in Section
\protect\hyperlink{forecasting-hierarchical-time-series}{Forecasting
hierarchical time series}. In this package, two functions, \emph{hts}
and \emph{gts}, produce forecasts for hierarchical and grouped time
series, respectively. Inputs for these functions include base forecasts
and hierarchy and group structure. Here base forecasts are forecasts in
all levels of hierarchy using only the history of each series and
ignoring hierarchy or group structure. In the optimal combination
method, there are two steps to determine the reconciled forecasts:
first, computing base forecasts and second reconciling those forecasts.
Currently options for computing the base forecasts are Random Walk (RW),
Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA).

When we encounter a large collection of time series computing base
forecasts using ETS or ARIMA can be computationally expensive. ETS
(function ``ets()'' in forecast package \autocite{hyndman2007automatic})
optimizing the likelihood function and since we can not specify trend
and seasonal components, it needs to search over all the possibilities
of the trend and seasonal components (non, additive and multiplicative).
Also ARIMA (function ``auto.arima()'' in forecast package
\autocite{hyndman2007automatic}) combines unit root tests, minimization
of the Akaike information criterion (AICc)
\autocite{akaike1998information} and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
to obtain an estimated ARIMA model \autocite{hyndman2018forecasting}.
Again, in ARIMA if we can not specify the order of the models for all
the series, the procedure searches over all the order combination
possibilities which make it computationally expensive. This
computational challenges increases in the number of lower level series
as well as in the number of hierarchies. We therefore propose a new
approach to compute the base forecasts that is both computationally fast
while maintaining an acceptable forecasting accuracy level.

\section{Proposed approach}\label{proposed-approach}

Our proposed approach is based on using linear regression models for
computing base forecasts. We begin with partitioning the dataset into
training and test sets. We denote by
\(\mathbf{y_t}=\{y_1,y_2,...,y_t\}\) and
\(\mathbf{y_h}=\{y_{t+1},y_{t+2},...,y_h\}\) the vector of time series
in the training and test set for \(h\)-step-ahead forecasts in all the
levels of hierarchy. The \(h\)-step-ahead base forecasts and reconciled
vectors are denoted by \(\mathbf{\widehat{y}_{h}}\) and
\(\mathbf{\tilde{y}_{h}}\), respectively. We also use \(\mathbf{X_t}\)
and \(\mathbf{X_h}\) to denote the matrices of predictors in the
training and test set, respectively.

The linear forecasting Ordinery Least Square (OLS) model is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:linearmodel}
   \mathbf{y_t} = \mathbf{X_t} \boldsymbol{\alpha_h}+\delta_h,
\end{equation}

where \(\boldsymbol{\alpha_h}\) is the vector of coefficients and
\(\delta_h\) is the error term with mean zero and constant variance. We
can estimate the reconciled coefficients in two ways: in two steps,
\textbf{two-step}, or in single step, \textbf{single-step}. The two-step
approach we should first estimate \(\boldsymbol{\alpha_h}\) using OLS
estimation :

\begin{equation}\label{eq:linearcoefficientstwosteps}
   \boldsymbol{\hat{\alpha}_h} = \mathbf{(X_t'X_t)^{-1}X_t'}\mathbf{y_t},
\end{equation}

and then using Equations \eqref{eq:linearcoefficientstwosteps} and
\eqref{eq:reconciledforecasts}, we can find the reconciled forecasts:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reconciledforecaststwosteps}
   \boldsymbol{\tilde{y}_h} = \mathbf{S(S'S)^{-1}S'}\mathbf{X_h}\boldsymbol{\hat{\alpha}_h}.
\end{equation}

We can use Equations \eqref{eq:linearcoefficientstwosteps} and
\eqref{eq:reconciledforecaststwosteps} to compute the base forecasts using
an OLS forecasting model and then to apply the reconciled forecasts.
However because both OLS and reconciliation steps are linear, we can
combine these two steps and compute the reconciled forecasts in one
step:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reconciledforecastsonestep}
   \boldsymbol{\tilde{y}_h} = \mathbf{S(S'S)^{-1}S'}\mathbf{X_h}\mathbf{(X_t'X_t)^{-1}X_t'}\mathbf{y_t}
\end{equation}

This single-step reconciliation approach is more parsimoneous and
elegant.

\subsection{OLS predictors}\label{ols-predictors}

As an example for the \(\mathbf{X_t}\) matrix in Equation
\eqref{eq:linearmodel}, we can refer to the set of predictors proposed in
\textcite{ashouri2018} for modeling trend, seasonality and
autocrrolation by using laged values (\(y_{t-1}\), \(y_{t-2}\),
\ldots{}) trend variables and seasonal dummy variables as a set of
predictors in the linear model. Equation \eqref{eq:linearmodelexample}
shows a linear equation of this type which models linear trend, additive
seasonality with \(m\) seasons, autocorrelation and external data. \(t\)
is the running index (\(t=1,2,...\)), and \(Season_{jt}\) is a dummy
variable taking value 1 if time \(t\) (\(j=1, 2, ..., m\)) is in season
\(j\), \(y_{t-k}\) is the \(k\)th lagged value for \(y_t\) and \(z_t\)
is the external data. For instance, if we have daily data with day of
week seasonality, \(m\) would be 7 (6 seasonal dummies and 7 the
violaton of lags).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:linearmodelexample}
   y_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 t + \beta_1 Season_{1t} + \beta_2 Season_{2t} + \cdots + \beta_{m-1} Season_{(m-1)t} + \gamma_1 y_{t-1} + \gamma_2 y_{t-2} + \cdots + \gamma_m y_{t-m} + \delta z_t\epsilon_t 
\end{equation}

While OLS is popular in practice for forecasting time series, it is
often frown upon due to its independence assumption. This can cause
issue for parametric inference but is less of a problem for forecasting,
in fact it offen performs sufficiently well for forecasting as can be
seen by its popular use in practice.

\section{Applications}\label{applications}

In this section we illustrate our approach two examples, forecasting
monthly Australian domestic tourism and forecasting daily Wikipedia
pageviews. We compare the forecasting accuracy levels of ETS, ARIMA and
the proposed linear OLS forecasting model, with and without the
reconciliation step. For comparing these methods we use the average of
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) across all series and also display box and
density plots for forecast errors along with the raw forecast errors.

Since we are using time series lags (\(1, ..., m\)) in the linear
forecasting model, we cant forecast multiple steps ahead. We therefore
apply two methods for generating \(h\)-step-ahead forecast: In the first
model we use 1-step-ahead forecasts and for forecasting the following
periods (\(t+2,t+3,...\)) we replace the previous periods with the
actual values. This value is known to us because it is in the test set.
In our applications, we call this approach `1-step-ahead'. In the second
method, we again use 1-step-ahead forecasts but for forecasting the
following periods we use the earlier forecasted values. In our
applications, we call this approach `\(h\)-step-ahead forecast'. We also
show the computation challenges in all the methods.

\subsection{Australian domestic
tourism}\label{australian-domestic-tourism}

This dataset has 19 years of monthly visitor nights in Australia by
Australian tourists. This measure is used as an indicator of tourism
activity \autocite{wickramasuriya2018optimal}. This data were collected
by computer-assisted telephone interviews with 120000, Australians aged
15 and up \autocite[Research tourism][]{researchAustralia2005}. In total
this dataset includes 304 time series with length 228 each. The
hierarchy and grouping structure for this dataset is made using
geographical and purpose of travel information.

In this dataset we have three levels of geographical divisions in
Australia. In the first level, Australia was divided into seven `States'
including New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (VIC), Queensland (QLD), South
Australia (SA), Western Australia (WA), Tasmania (TAS) and Northern
Territory (NT). In the second and third levels it is divided into 27
`Zones' and 76 `Regions' (for details about Australia geographical
divisions see Figure \ref{fig:Australiahierarchystructure} and Table
\ref{tab:Australiageographicaldivision}). For `Purpose' we have four
groups: Holiday (Hol), Visiting (Vis), Business (Bis) and Others (Oth).
Based on geographical hierarchy and purpose grouping, we end up with 8
levels of hierarchy with 555 series in total. The hierarchy structure
which is used in this example includes the following levels:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Level 0 = Total series
\item
  Level 1 = State
\item
  Level 2 = Zone
\item
  Level 3 = Region
\item
  Level 4 = Purpose
\item
  Level 5 = State \(\times\) Purpose
\item
  Level 6 = Zone \(\times\) Purpose
\item
  Level 7 = bottom level series
\end{itemize}

We report the forecast results for all these hierarchy levels, as well
as the average RMSE across all the levels of hierarchy.

In the predictor matrix, for the OLS forecasting model we apply linear
trend, 11 dummy variables, and 12 time series lags\footnote{Since the
  forecasting results are better without the lags, we just use a linear
  trend and dummy seasonality variables in our linear model for
  24-step-aehad model.}. This is intended to capture the monthly
seasonality. In addition, before running the model, we partition the
data into two parts, training and test sets. We keep the last 24 months
periods (2 years) as our test set to forecast and we use the rest as our
training set.

In Tables \ref{tab:Tourismdataresulrolling},
\ref{tab:TourismdataresultRMSE} and
\ref{tab:Tourismdatacomputationtime}, we have the average RMSE and
computation time for the 24-month forecast period. Methods include ETS,
ARIMA and our proposed OLS forecasting model. In Table
\ref{tab:Tourismdataresulrolling} we forecast 24 periods by computing
1-step-ahead forecasts and rolling forward month by month. In Table
\ref{tab:TourismdataresultRMSE} we genarated 24-step-ahead forecasts. In
these tables we have two parts related to the forecast, with and without
reconciliation.

The results in Table \ref{tab:Tourismdataresulrolling} and
\ref{tab:TourismdataresultRMSE} show that our proposed OLS forecasting
model produces forecast accuracy similar to ETS and ARIMA, which are
computationally heavy for many time series. Also they show the
usefulness of the reconciliation in decreasing the average RMSE in all
the three methods. Except for the total series, reconciliation can help
in forecasting all the hierarchy levels.

In Figures \ref{fig:boxplotrollingtourism}, \ref{fig:boxplottourism},

forecasts, and error density plots for reconciled forecasts using all

we see the error distribution similarity across all the models, as well
as usefulness of the reconciliation step in improving the forecasts. By
comparing density plots \ref{fig:densityplotrollingtourism} and
\ref{fig:densityplottourism}, as could be expected, we see that by
applying 1-step-ahead forecasts, the error densities are closer and more
distributed around zero.

Figure \ref{fig:forecstrolling24tourism} shows the 1-step-ahead and
24-step-ahead forecast results for one of the bottom level series,
BACBus (Geelong - Business). In these plots we have both reconciled
(solid lines) and unreconciled (dashed lines) forecasts and we see that
the reconciliation step improves the forecasts in this series. We also
see that the OLS model forecast accuracy is similar to the other two
methods.

Table \ref{tab:Tourismdatacomputationtime} compares the three methods,
computation time for 1-step-ahead and 24-step-ahead forecasting. We see
that the OLS forecasting model is much faster compared with the other
methods. Also, since reconciliation is a linear process, in all methods,
it is very fast and does not affect computation time significantly.

\subsection{Wikipedia pageviews}\label{wikipedia-pageviews}

The second dataset consists of one year of daily data (2016-06-01 to
2017-06-29) on Wikipedia pageviews for the most popular social networks
articles \autocite{ashouri2018}. This dataset is noisier compared with
the Australian monthly tourism data and forecasting its series is more
challenging. It has a grouped structure, with grouping attributes:
`Agent': Spider, User, `Access': Desktop, Mobile app, Mobile web,
`Language': en (English), de (German), es (Spanish), zh (Chinese) and
`Purpose': Blogging related, Business, Gaming, General purpose, Life
style, Photo sharing, Reunion, Travel, Video (check Table
\ref{tab:wikipediagroupingstructure}). We display the group structure in
Table \ref{tab:wikipediagroupingstructure} and Figure
\ref{fig:wikigroupstructure}. In Figure \ref{fig:wikigroupstructure} we
use one possible hierarchy for this dataset, but the order of the
hierarchy can be switched. The final dataset includes 913 time series,
each with length 394. The group structure and different levels include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Level 0 = Total
\item
  Level 1 = Agent
\item
  Level 2 = Access
\item
  Level 3 = Language
\item
  Level 4 = Purpose
\item
  Level 5 = bottom level series
\end{itemize}

For this daily dataset, in the OLS forecasting model we include in the
predictor matrix a linear trend, 6 seasonal dummies and 7 lags. We
partitioned the data into two parts training and test sets. We used the
last 28 days for our test set and the rest for the training set.

Table \ref{tab:wikipediadataresulrolling},
\ref{tab:wikipediadataresultRMSE} and
\ref{tab:wikipediadatacomputationtime} represent the RMSE results and
computation time. Although these time series are noisier, still we get
acceptable results for the OLS forecasting model compared with ETS and
ARIMA. In this case, we get similar results with and without the
reconciliation step in the forecasted errors.

Figures \ref{fig:boxplotrollingwiki} and \ref{fig:boxplotwiki} display
the forecast error box plot. These plots are for 1-step-ahead and
28-step-ahead forecasts in each level of grouping. Further, we can see
that the error distribution is almost similar in all levels across the
different methods. The only exception is the Total series, where ETS
performs significantly better than ARIMA and OLS. We also note that the
reconciliation is less effective.

Figures \ref{fig:densityplotrollingwiki} and \ref{fig:densityplotwiki}
show the density plots for the forecast errors. For both 1-step-ahead
and 28-step-ahead forecasts, we can see the density structure of the
forecast errors across ETS, ARIMA and the OLS forecasting model. Except
for the Total series which ETS works better, in all the other levels are
the models have similar structure for the forecast errors.

In Figure \ref{fig:forecstrolling28wiki}, we display results for one of
the bottom level series, desktopusenPho (desktop-user-english-photo
sharing). The plot shows 1-step-ahead and 28-step-ahead forecast results
for ETS, ARIMA and OLS, with (solid lines) and without (dashed lines)
applying reconciliation. We see that the OLS forecasting model performs
close to the other two methods, and reconciliation improves the
forecasts.

Lastly, Table \ref{tab:wikipediadatacomputationtime} presents the
computation times for all three methods. ETS and ARIMA are clearly much
more computationally heavy compared with OLS. As in the Australian
tourism dataset, running reconciliation does not have much effect on
computation time.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

We proposed a single-step linear approach to forecast hierarchical or
grouped time series in a much faster way, but with accuracy that nearly
matches that of forecast methods such as ETS and ARIMA. This is
especially useful in large collections of time series, as is typical in
hierarchical and grouped structures. Although ETS and ARIMA are good in
terms of forecasting power and accuracy, they can be computationally
heavy when facing large collections of time series in hierarchy. Adding
another faster option for calculating base forecasts was our purpose in
this research. Here we suggest a linear model, OLS, instead of ETS and
ARIMA which is not computationally intensive. We also showed that OLS
can compete ETS and ARIMA in terms of forecasting accuracy level. We
also note that OLS has the additional practice feature in handling
missing data while ETS and ARIMA requiers imputation. One more important
feature of our model is the ability to easily include external
information such as holiday dummies or other external series. In
addition to the computation adjustment, our proposed approach forecasts
hierarchical time series in a parsimoneas single step whereas other
available methods all forecast in two-steps.
